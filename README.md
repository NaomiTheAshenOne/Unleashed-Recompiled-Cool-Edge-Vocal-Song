# Unleashed Recompiled Cool Edge Vocal Song
A simple mod that replaces the Cool Edge day song with the vocal Cool Edge cover made by SnapCube

## Install Guide
Just add the zip found in the [release page](https://www.google.com) into your mod manager

My mods target the Unleashed Recompilation as it is the most accessible version, and may not work on other platforms
